# Final-project
## Scientific question
What's the potential relationship between vegetation growth over the Tibetan Plateau and large-scale climate variability (ENSO)?
## Summary
### Apply EOF to SSTa and NDVI to get principle components 
### Use Correlation Coefficient between PCs in two variables to find potential relationship between ENSO and NDVI
### Make a possible explanation for the relationship (combined with regional Temp and Precipitation data in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau)

## Data source
NDVI:https://ecocast.arc.nasa.gov/data/pub/gimms/3g.v1/;  https://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.UMD/.GLCF/.GIMMS/.NDVIg/.global/.ndvi/
ENSO:http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.KAPLAN/.EXTENDED/.v2/.ssta/
Temp &Prcp data are from the lab during my undergraduate and they are in .mat format.
